# Runtime Inspector and Hierarchy for Unity 3D
Simply drag&drop the **RuntimeInspector** and/or **RuntimeHierarchy** prefabs to your canvas and you are good to go!

You can connect the inspector to the hierarchy by dragging the inspector to **Connected Inspector** variable of hierarchy and vice versa by dragging the hierarhy to **Connected Hierarchy** variable of inspector.

You can use the skins in **Skins** folder or create your own skin using the **Create-RuntimeInspector-UI Skin** button. Just drag&drop the skin to the **Skin** property of the inspector and/or hierarchy to use it.

There's much more to say than that, stay tuned for a while!
